# CodeKataBattle Project
This is a complete software engineering project that shows all the steps taken to turn the stakeholders' specifications in natural language into a concrete implementation of the software product. 
The folders are structured in this way:
- DD stands for Design Document and it contains the Latex document describing the implementation details
- IMPLEMENTATION contains the Spring Boot implementation of the microservices
- RASD stands for Requirements Analysis and Spencification Document and it contains the Latex document describing the analysis of the requirements received by the stakeholders.
